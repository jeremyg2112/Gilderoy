    <p>Dear reader, you have been lied to. Assuming you are familiar with the works of J.K. Rowling, you all have heard the impossible story of the Chamber of Secrets and how a 12-year-old boy, unaided, defeated the basilisk and an apparition of the Dark Lord himself. It is due to my obligation to common decency and the integrity of the wizarding community that I must inform you that this sensational account of events is utterly false.</p>
    <p>What is undisputed is that Gilderoy Lockhart, Ronald Weasely, and Harry Potter did enter the Chamber together. As it were, the boys had been called to Mr. Lockhart's office for reprimanding after yet another bout of disruptive behavior in class, this time attempting to hex a fellow classmate to have cat whiskers. It was due to their childish, long-time grudge against Mr. Lockhart that Potter and Weasely took this opportunity alone with the Professor to deceive him and lure him into the Chamber of Secrets, claiming that a rabid pixie had been set loose in the girls' bathroom.</p>

    <p>In a moment of betrayal, Potter then held Mr. Lockhart at wand-point and proceeded to open the Chamber. Even as he was ambushed, the skillful professor was able to recall a hundred defensive spells that could have allowed him to escape the situation, but despite the circumstances, he refused to allow any harm to befall a young Hogwarts student over his watch. Then, without warning, and without any regard for their profressor's life, the boys cast Mr. Lockhart into the Chamber. Fortunately, our hero survived the plunge unscathed, but within a moment, the boys had arrived in the Chamber and drew their wands against him yet again.</p>
    <p>It was at this point that Mr. Lockhart heard an all-too-familiar slithering sound emitting from the darkness. The professor, intimately acquainted with every foul, mythical, and wonderous beast in the wizarding world, instantly recognized the sound and scent of a basilisk fast approaching. At once, the professor jumped in front of the helpless young wizards and shielded their eyes, for of the three only he knew that gazing into the basilisk's beaming yellow eyes would result in instant death. His maneuver was just in time, as the basilisk lept out of the darkness, aiming its death stare straight toward them. Mr. Lockhart, eyes closed, drew his wand and casted a series of potent spells to quickly slay the beast.</p> 
    <p>There was a moment's silence as Mr. Lockhart inspected the limp corpse of the serpent, to ensure that it had indeed perished in its struggle against him. The boys watched in disbelief, and waited. The moment Mr. Lockhart's work was finished, Potter and Weasely drew their wands and muttered the only incantation they could think of to get themselves out of the heap of trouble they had just caused.</p>
    <em><p>"Obliviate!"</p></em>
    <p>If only the professor hadn't been busy slaying the basilisk... If only he hadn't continued to have faith in the boys, and had simply petrified them right away... If only... then Gilderoy Lockhart might be here now, telling this story himself. But as fate would have it, the boys' Memory Charm met its unsuspecting target, and Mr. Lockhart's memory was irreparably damaged.</p>
    <p>Later, the boys would go on to spin their tale about how in fact Mr. Potter had defeated the basilisk alone, and that Mr. Lockhart had been too much of a coward to do what even a 12-year-old boy could accomplish. They went on to tell a thrilling story about how "You-Know-Who" was actually behind it all, and how Harry had defeated him, too. It was a lavish tale indeed, which became even more grandiose over time, eventually incorporating phoenixes, cursed magical artifacts, and even a legendary Gryffindor heirloom. But this wonderous account was grossly, entirely false, simply a result of Mr. Potter's unquenchable desire for fame.</p> 
    <p>It is only due to modern breakthroughs in legilimency that Potter and Weasely's accounts of the events have been proven false, and the true story extracted from Mr. Lockhart's subconscious mind. Perhaps Mr. Potter may have had an extraordinary career in writing, leaving a trail of obliviated wizards behind him, had it not been for these breakthroughs.</p>
    <p>Mr. Lockhart's deeds were, and continue to be, a great service to the wizarding community. If you wish to know more about his incredible life, read his published works, or simply gaze in wonder at him, you may access the links below.</p>
